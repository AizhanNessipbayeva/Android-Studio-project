          In Canada, a series of artist-run organizations often known as "parallel galleries" or artist-run centres (ARCs) have developed in cities across the country since the 1960s to encourage the exhibition of contemporary works by
           Canadian and international artists. The purpose is often to provide alternative spaces for exhibition for emerging
           artists and contemporary artists outside the commercial gallery system. Canadian ARCs usually pay a fee and de-emphasize
            the selling of work, although this will vary from gallery to gallery. A recommended schedule of payment is provided by
            the Canadian Artists' Representation (CARFAC), an artists' advocacy group.
